# CommitmentsOfTradersMQL5Indicator

The repository contains a MQL5 indciator that can be used to display the COT (Commitments of Traders) data that is published weekly by the CFTC. The COT repot can give us information about the futures positions of huge companies, financial institutions and retail traders. Traders use it to identify the flow of "smart money" and "dumb money". The MQL5 indicator is implemented with help of the internetlib.mqh (WinInet.dll class, https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/73) and the JAson.mqh file (JSON serialization and deserialization class, https://www.mql5.com/en/code/13663). Read more about the COT market report here: https://www.cftc.gov/MarketReports/CommitmentsofTraders/index.htm and about the COT market report API here: https://publicreporting.cftc.gov/stories/s/Legacy-Futures/yjak-hhbj/ and here: https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/publicreporting.cftc.gov/6dca-aqww. This is an example of the API call using a normal HTTP request: https://publicreporting.cftc.gov/resource/6dca-aqww.json?contract_market_name=GOLD&$where=report_date_as_yyyy_mm_dd%3E%272024%27
